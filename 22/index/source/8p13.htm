    The asylum was one of the biggest buildings in the quiet downtown area. There wasn't much privacy - just an enormous room full of chairs and beds, with elderly, young, and sick people peacefully laying down, waiting to have earned enough karma for an elder god to accept them.

    It was one of the cheapest places in the city, so it was where I called home. I could afford a better place, but I didn't see a reason to live anywhere else. I found my hammock and table not far off and let my coat down before taking a quick shower and getting in for bed.
