    For most people, growing older brings people of disparate ages closer together than they might have been as children. However, at this time in our lives, it could not have been more different for us. Wanu, Uo, and I had grown up tightly, but Wanu was getting married soon and Uo was still a child. I was right on the cusp of both life stages, so I did my best to hold us together, but it was tenative.

    Uo and I walked towards the grounds. He hadn't changed much over the past few years, and his excitement towards the festival showed it. "You excited for the festival, Moon?"
</p>
<p>
    Sure thing! Don't stray too far.

    Navigating him around the festival wouldn't be <i>too</i> much of a challenge, I supposed. I would just have to pay attention.
