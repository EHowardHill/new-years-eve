    I can't help but feel as if I have made my first bold step into hell.

    "Alright," said Seok, "Now we wait. The train ought to come at any moment now."

    It's bizarre how different the station seems after everyone has vacated the premises. It's easy to feel alone when
    you're in a crowd. But when the crowd is gone, it's much harder.

    Not far away is a <button onclick="vending()">vending
        machine</button>, as well as a <button
        onclick="alert('It looks thoroughly closed for now. There is not anything beyond the counter I could want or need. Besides - I was already stacking up charges against me, I had no reason to add theft to that list.')">ticket
        booth</button>. There was <button onclick="alert('I could have gone for a rice cake right about now.')">once a
        store</button> selling.. what was it? Rice cakes? No matter - it's closed now. To my <button
        onclick="coin();">right
        are the train tracks</button>, which seem unusually vacant for the time being. I'm unsure as to why Seok was so
    sure
    that a train would be coming soon after hours, but I suppose it's best not to question his judgement.
