        We sons and daughters of Ore perform a certain tradition a few months after birth. Our parents take us to the
        temple, and the scribe hands us a pen. This comes with the freedom to scribble a pattern. Sometimes the children
        will write on themselves, but more often than not, the ink makes its way to the paper. Once the child is content
        with writing, our scribes compare his or her nonsense writing to that of our ancestors. If it is original, then
        the scribe acknowledges that the child is a new soul. If not, then the scribe recognizes the child as the
        incarnation of an old soul. We may receive a new name upon birth, but our second name, our ancient name, is
        given to us during this ceremony. For example, I know that, according to our records, I have been born at least
        three times.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I understand there is no such tradition for the Chitotzish. If I had been born a son of Chitz, I would
        have no clue what my past lives would have been like. For many, I imagine this would be a reprieve. A guilty
        conscious is wiped clean upon death. But for me, the uncertainty would be debilitating. Too many past sins ache
        us even today, as the perpetrators walk around in our midst, none the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, even the certainty of my ancient name is not enough. I feel as if I am made of cheesecloth. My
        history is tattered and full of holes. I feel guilty for past sins I am not aware of. It is my conviction that
        this is in part to blame for a certain sickness among not only the Oroein but the Chitotzish people as well.
        This is a sickness that has incubated for centuries, and it seems as if the end is growing nearer every day.

        In part, that is why I'm writing you today. I understand that you have been a courier for many years and that
        this, out of nescessity, is going to be your last mission. I do not have a death wish. I know there is an allure
        surrounding Glenetz village, whether it be due to the government's ban on entry, or the folklore involving it.
        Aside from this, I am convinced that this trip is not negotiable.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of my funds are at your disposal, although I understand neither of us need any money in the afterlife. I
        have already taken care of my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I understand that no one can travel back alive. The answers I will find are worth the cost. To deny me answers is to deny me
        my birthright. I have never had more reason to play with fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that is why I seek a guide. I urge you to consider my application.
