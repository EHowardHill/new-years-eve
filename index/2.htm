    Good souls come back after death.<br>
    Bad souls stay down below until they can earn enough karma to join the good souls.<br>
    But the souls without gods, after death, must go to <i>Wingyu Opwe</i> - the Waiting Place.<br>
    Most of us, with enough time and patience, find gods kind enough to let us return to life.<br>
    Some of us are still waiting.
</p>
<p>
    After death, your body remains just as it did the moment of your death. This means that many of us cursed to Wingyu Opwe are battered, diseased, deformed, too old, or too young to be of much use. Those of us who are in good enough shape to work have quite a lot of responsibilities.

    My name is Munsig Park. I'm an Oroean - the last one - and I work as a messenger and escort for the Imwe City Messenger service.
