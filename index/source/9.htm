    I was eleven years old, maybe twelve.
</p>
<p>
    I had woken up in the middle of the night and slipped from my family's small hanok farmhouse into a small patch of grass close to our fence. The moon was high in the sky, and I could barely see, but I knew this place far too well to feel nervous.
</p>

    On the outskirts of our village was a large fence, keeping us away from the mountains. On the other end of the mountains was the nation of Chitotz. My friends Wanu and Uo had agreed to climb the mountain and get a look at Chitotz with our own eyes, but we would have to be secretive. Too much noise and we'd never hear the end of it.
