    The man wasn't terribly young, nor did he seem to be the sturdiest man in Wingyu Opwe, but he made quick work of picking Moon up and onto his back. His neck wasn't in good enough condition to move just yet, but the cinnamon water had done wonders for easing the pain just a little - and soon enough, it would be just healed enough for him to be able to speak again.

    With his head cocked to the side, Moon was able to get a view of Gumeong valley. Those wicked mountains surrounded a meadow with the occasional tree, not as large as Moon may have liked, but not too small for a village to comfortably live. The sound of birds originally took Moon off-guard - he hadn't heard many birds in the eastern region of elder Sungho's domain. As the sun was going down rapidly, the cicadas had taken to the air as well. It helped to drown out the ringing in his ears.

    Moon knew that the asylum he lived in was getting a little full, and having effectively terminated his job, he wondered how feasible it might be to live here instead of Imwe city. This seemed like a much better place to spend an eternity.
</p>
<p>
    When they reached the village itself, it was much like Imwe City - many buildings, most of them seemingly abandoned. The elder gods loved to make buildings regardless of how practical they might be to those living in them, and it wasn't uncommon to catch all types of buildings from life repurposed as nothing but asylumns for the young, sick, and old.

    "Himchan", he said, introducing himself. "Himchan Damyo. So, your neck... You were decapitated, weren't you? What were you in life, a criminal? I have no judgement for that, you know. I did my own share of thievery in life. I got run-through by one of the people whose house I broke into. Now you know why my back feels strange during that little ride, haha."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll be taking you to where my home is. My grandson Hyun lives with me there. We'll get you taken care of and get you on your way."
</p>
<p>
    "The sun's going down soon, though, so it's best that you take it easy until the morning time, hm?"
</p>
<p>
    His grandson, who wasn't really his grandson, he went on to tell me - they were around two-hundred years apart, albeit he was a direct descendant - didn't say much to Moon during his stay. He just showed up, got the bed ready without question, and headed off. I was too tired to make any fuss, but I was hopeful that my throat would be good enough to ask questions in the morning.
</p>
<p>
    To the sun god and moon goddess, or whoever orchestrated these events, he was grateful that he had been found by someone good.
