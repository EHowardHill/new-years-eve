    It took a long time, but I finally made it to his home. Compared to the office, it was unusually quiet this far away from the city - I couldn't hear anything besides the wind. It was a nice change of pace.
</p>

<p>
    I knocked on the door twice. I knew he wasn't in a good enough position to get up and answer it; the knock was more for courtesy than anything else.
</p>

<p>
    "Mr. Burn? Hello? It's Munsig Park - I'm here with the Imwe Messenger Serivce."
</p>

<p>
    Entering his home, I noticed that it was barely furnished. This man clearly wasn't going to spend his karma on anything frivolous. He was ready to return to life.
</p>

<p>
    I caught him in his chair. If you didn't know any better, you'd have assumed he was barely hanging on for life with how much effort went into each breath. He had probably been here, sitting in this chair, for over a hundred years.
</p>

<p>
    I pulled up a chair and sat close to hear him speak.
</p>

<p>
    "Good afternoon, Mr. Burn."
</p>

<p>
    He looked up at me slowly, smiling. "Tell me, son, is to-day the day?"
</p>

<p>
    "Indeed it is." I pulled the envelope from my bag and showed it to him. "The elder god Dobromila accepted your application."
</p>

<p>
    He sighed. "I suppose it could be worse."
</p>

<p>
    "Are you ready to reincarnate?"
</p>

<p>
    He turned a little to look out at his field and let out a sigh. "I've been here four-hundred years. I didn't suppose I would feel unprepared when the time came to leave. You know, I've been working on a memoir. Could you take it to the library for me? How much karma would it cost? 10 eob?"
</p>

<p>
    I smiled. "Don't worry about it. I'll take it as a favor."
</p>

<p>
    "You're a good young man. Maybe I'll see you in a future life."
</p>

<p>
    On a table nearby was a glass of water. I took a cinnamon stick from my coat and mixed it in. To the rest of us, this wouldn't do much besides make our memories of life hazy and the pain in our bodies numb. But to someone under the jurisdiction of an elder god, this mixture does much more.
</p>

<p>
    He drank deeply from it, and as he did, I could see the edges of his form become hazy. As if he were made of fireflies, he dissolved into the air as if he had never been to Wingyu Opwe.
</p>

<p>
    "Take care of yourself, Mr. Burn," I said, standing up and getting ready to leave.
