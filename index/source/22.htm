    I was dreaming of my previous life again.
</p>
<p>
    I was at my small, cottage home, grabbing some food before I went back out into the fields. There was a knock at the door. This wasn't uncommon.
</p>
<p>
    It was Wanu. "Moon, we need to talk."
</p>
<p>
    "Hm? What about? It is Roro?" Roro was his fiance.
</p>
<p>
    "Sort of." he sighed. "I'm asking her out to the festival tonight. It's about Uo. I want tonight to be about Roro and I, and I'm afraid he won't want to leave us alone. I was wondering if you could.. uh.. keep him busy tonight."
</p>
<p>
    Laughing a bit under my breath, I felt relieved. "I'll do my best." I supposed the fields could wait for an evening. After all, the festival wasn't going to be in the village all season.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you, Moon. I'll buy you a tray of cookies or something."
