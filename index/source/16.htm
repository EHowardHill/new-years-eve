    I could hear a voice from not too far away. I couldn't see his face, but I didn't need to.
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
    That voice... an Oroean! My, my. It's you, isn't it? The last Oroean? So beautiful...
</p>

<p>
    "Tell me what you want or go away. I'm busy."
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
    You must have had too much cinnamon, pet. You don't remember a thing, do you? Not even your old friend Scratch? Tell me... Who sent you into these mountains? You're a messenger, aren't you? Working for the Chitotzish, no less. How insulting it must feel, after everything they did to your people.
</p>

<p>
    I pulled out a sword from my bad. "Leave me alone."
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
    I am so patient, but something this delicious? The last Oroean? One last light to snuff out? Oh, I can hardly wait to grind your bones to ash...
</p>

    Run well, little Oroean child, but not too well. Y̸o̸u̷ ̶w̸i̷l̸l̴ ̴b̸e̵ ̶e̵a̷s̵i̷e̴r̸ ̸t̶o̷ ̸d̸i̶s̸s̴o̴l̸v̸e̴ ̴w̸h̶e̴n̷ ̸t̴i̵r̷e̶d̵.̷
