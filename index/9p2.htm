    It didn't surprise me that Wanu and Uo got there first. Uo was a couple of years younger than me, but Wanu was nearly a man - he must have led Uo up the mountain.
</p>
<p>
    Once we got to the top, seeing wasn't an issue. The capital of Chitotz was within our sight. It glowed like a second moon, even in the middle of the night. The number of buildings was nearly incomprehensible to me as a child.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm going to go there one day," said Wanu, confidently.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh yeah?" asked Uo. "What's stopping you from going there right now?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why don't <i>you</i> do it, Uo?" I asked.
</p>
<p>
    Wanu sighed. "Let's just stay here for tonight. It's dangerous enough being here as-is. If either of you got caught by someone or slipped.."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, shut up," groaned Uo.
</p>
<p>
    I wish I could relive that night.
    I wouldn't change a thing.
    I just wish I could remember what it was like to see the sleeping dragon for the first time.
