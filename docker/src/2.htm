            Good souls come back after death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bad souls stay down below until they can earn enough karma to join the good souls.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the souls without gods, after death, must go to <i>Wingyu Opwe</i> - the Waiting Place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of us, with enough time and patience, find gods kind enough to let us return to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of us are still waiting.
