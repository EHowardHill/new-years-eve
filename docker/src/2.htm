                <p>It had been a long time since I was twelve years old, but I can't quite tell you how long. When I awoke in the caverns, I felt sore, but not old. My mind was swimming in a profound sense of confusion. I had one memory to hold onto, but nothing else.</p>
                <p>My clothes were in bad shape - their white color stained with black smudges and light tearing. It stayed on my body and kept me a little warmer, but the occasional, uninvited gust of wind through the caverns chilled my bones.</p>
                <p>I turned to glance at whatever was in my hand. It was an empty bottle. I lifted it to my nose and noticed it smelled like cinnamon. My mouth may have been dry, but it had begun to ache. I needed water.</p>
                <p>I thought I heard some dripping nearby, so I got up to go investigate it. The caverns were cold and damp, and I wanted to leave as soon as I could, but I knew that water couldn't have been far. And sure enough - there was a stalactite hanging from the roof of the tunnel, dripping a steady stream of water. In my desperation, I got close to it and opened my mouth below, catching what drops I could. It tasted bitter, but it didn't matter - anything to get the taste of bile out of my mouth.</p>
                <p>I heard something move nearby, so I froze. It must have been some instability in the cavern since it seemed to stop as soon as it started. It couldn't have been anything alive.</p>
                <p>"Speak to me," I heard, though the sounds were so strange and croaking that I barely registered it as a voice at all.</p>
                <p>I turned around to find a creature looming over me, its face nearly close enough to bite off my face. I couldn't make much sense of it - its face was long and green like a scaly deer skull, and its body was something like a bundle of sticks.</p>
                <p>It lifted a human hand to caress my cheek.</p>
                <p>"Oh, an Oroean.." it said gently. "You must be the last one. So beautiful.."</p>
                <p>I was too scared and confused to speak, so I stepped backwards, hitting my head on the stalactite, nearly tripping on the floor.</p>
                <p>"You've had too much cinnamon, pet," it said. "You don't remember a thing, do you? Not even your old friend, Old Scratch? Very well. I don't know what you've chosen to do so far in these caverns. Tell me, was it Dalnim who sent you so far into these mountains? Did she have a message for you?"</p>
                <p>I stared at him, unable to respond.</p>
                <p>The creature began to make a warm, creaking noise. "Very well. I am so patient, but something this delicious? The last Oroean.. Oh, I can hardly wait to grind your skin to ash." It reached into its torso and seemed to pull something out from underneath the branches. It was an inky black and glittered like gasoline, its shape a writhing mass of arms. "Run well, but not too well - you will be easier to dissolve when you're tired."</p>
                <p></p>

                <p></p>
                <p>It was all a blur. I was so scared that all I could hear was my own heartbeat in my head. I heard that wretched thing behind me for so long, slapping its hands against the stony floor of the cave. Sometimes it got quieter, but I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't let it get to me. Not if I had any energy in me left at all.</p>
                <p>After several minutes, I felt as if I had finally gotten a chance to lose it. The sunlight wasn't too far away, now. </p>
                <p>It grabbed my leg.</p>
                <p>It was painful, but the sensation was worse than pain. Something deep in my soul rung like a bell. Even if I had felt nothing, I would have known that something was fundamentally wrong. It was as if the creature were sucking the breath from my lungs.</p>
                <p>On my left was a rock. I picked it up and began to bash it against the arm. It didn't do much - it had held on tight, but I kept going.</p>
                <p>Not this soon.. Not this soon..</p>
                <p>It let go, retreating into the cavern depths. The pain was gone. I sighed in relief, taking a deep, quivering breath and doing my best to stand. I could not, though. The creature had taken my left leg from the knee down.</p>
                <p>Not far away was a light. Maybe if I just got closer to it.. Maybe if I could just reach it..</p>
                <p>I used the walls of the cave to balance myself. I could feel my consciousness losing strength with every delirious step. It was so close..</p>
                <p>It was at that point that I collapsed and fell asleep once more.</p>
