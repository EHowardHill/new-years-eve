                </center>
                <p>When I was about twelve years old, two friends and I decided to sneak out of our homes at night and climb the mountain that stood at the edge of our village. It was strictly off-limits, both by our parents and by the village elders. There were signs posted in two languages along the base a conservative distance from each other â€“ our village would have installed a fence, but that would have easily cost us more money than we had. Nothing could physically hold us back.</p>
                <p>My friend Uo was the type to ignore rules that didn't make sense to him. I'm pretty sure that Wanu only came because he knew that he couldn't stop us, and he'd rather be there to help than wake up the next morning to both of us dead. Why did I come? Insatiable curiosity. For better or for worse, I knew that the city of Sakuranoka sat on the other side of that mountain, and I had always wanted to see it with my own eyes. I was twelve years old, now - I was a man, and to me at the time, that meant I had a right to know what it looked like.</p>
                <p>I caught Uo and Wanu on the other side of the signs, carrying backpacks. They were hardly waiting for me to catch up, but they did slow down just a bit.</p>
                <p>"Oh, thank goodness," said Uo, noticing my approach. "It's about time - I had to wake Wanu up and I wasn't going to wake you up, too."</p>
                <p>"Clearly," I replied. "So, are we doing this?"</p>
                <p>"Well," sighed Uo, "We've already passed the signs and broken the rules, so we might as well just keep going, right?"</p>
                <p>It took a little over an hour. Adrenaline was keeping me awake, but I already knew that this little escapade was going to exhaust me in the morning. I'd have to come up with some excuse for the inevitable bags under my eyes.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The three of us talked on the way up, but looking back on the talk, I can't say that I remember much of it. I'd have been paying better attention if I had known how important this moment would have been to me, I think.</p>
                <p>When we reached the top, I couldn't help but admire the sleeping dragon that was Sakuranoka. I had no idea how important it would be to me someday. I had no idea how much pain it would cause. The danger of a sleeping dragon is inconsequential when you're admiring it from a distance.</p>
                <p>The city sat in a basin larger than any I had ever seen, albeit one with discernable edges. The black mountain range that surrounded it was gently illuminated by the nearly immeasurable boxes, some taller than others, but all glowing with a hazy blue hue. There weren't many people on its streets, but I was sure that if I had come to visit in the daytime, things would be different.</p>
                <p>"I'm going to go there someday," said Wanu with a determined stare in his eyes.</p>
                <p>"Oh yeah?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah." He pointed at a particularly tall building in the center of the city - a glassy pyramid. "That's where I want to go."</p>
                <p>I was dying to know what was inside of it the moment he had pointed the pyramid out. "Oh yeah? What is it?"</p>
                <p>"I have no idea."</p>
                <p>Uo opened his satchel and grabbed a canteen. "How about going now?"</p>
                <p>"NO!" Wanu hissed. "This is far enough for tonight."</p>
                <p>"Well... Then how about tomorrow night?"</p>
                <p>Wanu crossed his arms. "Too soon. Far in the future. But we're going."</p>
                <p>"I guess we don't have a choice." I sighed. "I don't know how to go back home now that I've seen that. It's just... it's so big."</p>
                <p>We stayed for a few more hours, staring at the city and tossing a ball back and forth to each other. I remember that we somehow managed to return before the sun came up. A part of me was still worried about the next day and how exhausted I would inevitably be, but most of me was still imagining the city, turning it over in my head and trying to grasp the sheer scale of it. I think I dreamed about it, too.</p>
                <p>I wish I could relive that night. I wouldn't do anything differently - I just wish I could remember how it felt to behold that sleeping dragon for the first time.</p>
